## Dataset

> The data consists of information regarding 183,412 bike share trips records, including duration, user type, gender and other important characteristics. The dataset can be obtained through this link: https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/October/5f91cf38_201902-fordgobike-tripdata/201902-fordgobike-tripdata.csv


## Summary of Findings

> After we did some preliminary wrangling, new variables were engineered while others were removed, some other variables were modified to have more appropriate datatypes or units. We decided that our variables of interest would be user types and  Then we pursued with the exploration which were divised into 3 main components: the unvariate exploration, the bivariate exploration and finally the multi-variate exploration. To sum up, during the first part we could see that the smaller numbers of trips were registered during weekends and that subscribers and male users were a lot more represented. In the second part, we could notice that customer users had more than two times longer rides than subscribers and that females had slightly longer rides than males. Finally on the third part, we noted that even tho most people didn't ride on weekends, it was the period with longest ride durations.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> For the presentation, we start by exploring how often there are trips throughout the day and their duration all according to each type of user; before that we  present the variables necessary for the study and how they were obtained; at the end we use histograms and barplots to complete the analysis.

> Afterwards, we bring our attention on the week days when the most trips were taken according to each type of user as well, we also investigate the duration in minutes of the trip per day. A pointplot and a line plot are both generated to showcase the result.

> Finally, we study how often users are doing all trip bike shares according to their gender and age. A pointplot have been used for a better understanding.
